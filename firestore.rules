/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MegaCalc Hub Analytics.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to all analytics data (calculator categories, page views, and search queries).
 * All authenticated and unauthenticated users can create analytics events (page views and search queries).
 * No update or delete operations are permitted on analytics data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /calculator_categories/{calculatorCategoryId}: Stores calculator category metadata.
 * - /calculator_page_views/{calculatorPageViewId}: Stores calculator page view events.
 * - /search_queries/{searchQueryId}: Stores search queries made by users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All analytics data is publicly readable to facilitate reporting and dashboards.
 * - Write-Only Analytics: Only create operations are permitted for page views and search queries. Data immutability simplifies the analytics pipeline.
 * - No User-Specific Data: Anonymous authentication means no user-specific data segregation is required.
 * - No Update/Delete: Update and delete operations are explicitly denied for all users to ensure data integrity.
